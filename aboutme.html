    <h3 id="experience"><p>My Experience</p></h3>
      <div class="experience">
          <p>I have been working in construction for the last five years.  In that time I have learned quite a lot.  Cheif among them was how to work as team to create a piece of art.  Many may not look upon a building as such but after years of building them I can say otherwise.  They have a beauty to them when you know what has to go into them and some are built to show that beauty, but I digress.  I was also a food server and learned how to communicate with different people on a everyday basis.  I am now learning how to write computer code which I hope to turn into a new career.  I am grateful for my past experience for I believe it will make me a great programmer.  I can draw upon my old jobs to help create this new art.  Programers work as a team and need to be able to communicate with one another everyday to create their masterpieces.  I am hoping to take my past and create a brighter future.

    <h3 id="family"><p>My Family</p></h3>
      <div class="family">
          <p>I know it may seem strange to write about ones family but mine has always been there for me no matter my situation and therefore deserves to be written about.  After I left college I took a position as a secretary for an insulation company.  My family supported my decsion to take the job when I left school and supported me even more after my son was born.  Even to this day they support me.  Helping me out when I need it and cheering me on when I became a fully liscened carpenter.  Now that I am trying changing my career path they are again helping me out in anyway they can.  Wheather they are just lending an ear or trying to put me on the right path to my ultimate goal, they are always have been and always will be there for me.
